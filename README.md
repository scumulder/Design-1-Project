# Design-1-Project
Contains all my code for my final project of Engineering Design 1 course at UF. 

The project is a dual-sensor digital thermometer with the following hardware:  
1. ATmega324P   
2. TMP36 temperature sensor  
3. Thermistor  
4. 16x2 LCD  
5. 8 ohm speaker  
6. 10-bit DAC 

The temperature values from both the sensors are displayed on the LCD display. If the temperature crosses a certain threshold value, an "alarm" goess off via the DAC + speaker system.
